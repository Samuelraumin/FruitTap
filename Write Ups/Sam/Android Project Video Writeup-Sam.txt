FruitTap Video Writeup
        In the video, the boot logo is the first to show. When the boot is finished with a 4-second uptime, the main menu appears. There are two functioning buttons at the bottom of the screen, “Start” and “About the Coders”. When you click on “Start”, the game brings you to a different screen, prompting the player with a ready screen. After a second of the ready screen, it disappears, starting the game. The program chooses a random number between 1 to 4, the sprites in order being Apple, Banana, Pineapple, and Bomb. The objective is to click the fruit before it hits the bottom of the screen. When the fruit is clicked, a sound will play to alert the player that the fruit has been tapped. If the fruit reaches the bottom of the screen, the system calls for a game over. Make sure not to click the bomb as that will end in a game over as well. When the bomb sprite is clicked, a different sound will play, alerting the player that the bomb was touched. The game does not count for the bomb touching the bottom of the screen as a game over. The system keeps track of your score labeled “Fruit Points”. The score resets when the game resets. When a game over is called, a splash screen saying game over will appear, along with a button labeled “Reset”. Once you hit the reset, the game starts over to the boot screen.
