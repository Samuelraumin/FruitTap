FruitTap
        For our Android App Project, we created our app, FruitSap, based on the very famous mobile phone game, Fruit Ninja. We ran into various issues dealing with the building of this app. One of our biggest problems was the positioning of the fruit after a certain time. The system kept replacing the fruit sprites in various location incorrectly, which caused the game to crash commonly on the emulator. We later fixed the issue when we found a math error (definition points were upset) with the reset position and blocks in areas they need to be in. This gave us the opportunity to learn how the position math works in better detail. Another huge issue we had was the falling of the fruit. As the fruit is supposed to start from the top of the screen and fall to the bottom, the sprites were moving to the right. We later realized that more code was needed to define the direction in which the fruit needs to fall. One part that I did do independently was the management of the git. The git program was giving the team issues when it came to unrelated histories. The solution was later found online as a pull request was needed to make the git and home folder communicate with the addition of the extension --allow-unrelated-histories. I had a great time working with Dustin, as he was an excellent worker and team member.
